# Hello and welcome to my portfolio!
## This is meant to display projects I have finished, and those I am working on.
## This is supposed to serve as a top level view of my work, for the actual code, click on the project name!.

# [Project 1: Tely 10 Race Success] (#https://github.com/OmarTAbdelgawad/Tely10-Race-Visualization)
* When asked about the success of the Tely10 race, I decided to develop visualizations that approach the problem in different perspectives
* - Utilized Jupyter-lab and python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly express to generate graphs
* - Visualized success from more than one perspective, whether that be sponsors, or from the runners perspective. 
* - Made sure all visualizations were intuitive to understand, and most of them being interactive too.

# [Project 2: Olympic Athletes Analysis] (https://github.com/OmarTAbdelgawad/Olympic-Athletes-Analysis)
* Utilized Jupyter-lab, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and ipywidgets to come up with interactive visualizations like
* - A violin plot show-casing the heights of olympic athletes belonging to different sports
* - A heat-map that shows the height-weight distribution of athletes of different sports

# [Project 3: Course Videos Analysis] (https://github.com/OmarTAbdelgawad/Course-Video-Analysis)
* Given datasets that hold my university course's video information such as daily view count, I developed data visualizations that
* - Utilized Jupyter-lab and python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly express to generate graphs
* - Displayed which videos were the most popular, possibly displaying that the material covered was particularly challenging resulting in a rewind
* - Displayed the change of views since release day for each video, to see how student viewing habits change
* - Discovered that Wednesday was the most popular day for course video viewing, based on this polar graph!

# [Project 4: PHDs per country] (https://github.com/OmarTAbdelgawad/PHDs-per-country)
* Given a dataset of PHD students for multiple fields in many countries, I developed an interactive scatterplot that allows the user 
* to navigate different PHD % based on gender per country. 
* - Utilized Jupyter-lab, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and ipywidgets 

# Project 5: Football Analysis (In-Progress)
* Given a dataset of goalscorers for each season across multiple leagues in football, I am generating visualizations that
* - Utilize Jupyter-lab, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and ipywidgets to create interactive visualizations
* - Showcase the most lethal strikers across Europes top leagues
* - Display strikers goal return against their expected goal return at the start of the season
* - Generate a heatmap of where they are usually located on the field and how often
